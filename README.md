# coverity-splunk-app
...with sources
  * Splunk App for monitoring and analyzing Synopsys Coverity Connect events, metrics, and stats
  * The dashboard panels developed for troubleshooting Coverity Connect client issues, they are probably overkill for real time monitoring, but the search expressions are reusable for your simplified dashboards.
# Quick Start:
  * Install app from file: coverity.tgz
  * No source necessary
  * Preserving changes you made (this is how I do it, smarter people should do smarter suggestions welcome)
      * From the splunk directory `bin/splunk package app coverity`
